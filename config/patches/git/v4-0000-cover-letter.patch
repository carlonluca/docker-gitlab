Subject: [PATCH v4 00/12] Rewrite packfile reuse code

This patch series is rewriting the code that tries to reuse existing
packfiles.

The code in this patch series was written by GitHub, and Peff nicely
provided it in the following discussion:

https://public-inbox.org/git/3E56B0FD-EBE8-4057-A93A-16EBB09FBCE0@jramsay.com.au/

The first versions of this patch series were also discussed:

v3: https://public-inbox.org/git/20191115141541.11149-1-chriscool@tuxfamily.org/
V2: https://public-inbox.org/git/20191019103531.23274-1-chriscool@tuxfamily.org/
V1: https://public-inbox.org/git/20190913130226.7449-1-chriscool@tuxfamily.org/

Thanks to the reviewers!

According to Peff this new code is a lot smarter than what it
replaces. It allows "holes" in the chunks of packfile to be reused,
and skips over them. It rewrites OFS_DELTA offsets as it goes to
account for the holes. So it's basically a linear walk over the
packfile, but with the important distinction that we don't add those
objects to the object_entry array, which makes them very lightweight
(especially in memory use, but they also aren't considered bases for
finding new deltas, etc). It seems like a good compromise between the
cost to serve a clone and the quality of the resulting packfile.

This series has been rebased onto current master ad05a3d8e5 (The fifth
batch, 2019-12-10).

Other changes since the previous patch series have all been suggested
by Peff. Thanks to him! They are the following:

  - Add note in commit message of patch 3/12.

  - Move previous patch 4/9 to patch 12/12 at the end of the series to
    avoid test failures.

  - Add new patches 5/12 and 6/12.

  - Improve commit message and documentation of pack.allowPackReuse in
    patch 8/12.

  - Improve commit message of patch 10/12.

  - Extract patch 11/12 from patch 10/12.
