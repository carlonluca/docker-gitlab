# Redis settings

## Using a non-packaged Redis instance

If you want to use your own Redis instance instead of the bundled Redis, you
can use the `gitlab.rb` settings below. Run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` for the
settings to take effect.

```ruby
redis['enable'] = false

# Redis via TCP
gitlab_rails['redis_host'] = 'redis.example.com'
gitlab_rails['redis_port'] = 6380

# OR Redis via Unix domain sockets
gitlab_rails['redis_socket'] = '/tmp/redis.sock' # defaults to /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.socket
```

## Making a bundled Redis instance reachable via TCP

Use the following settings if you want to make one of the Redis instances
managed by omnibus-gitlab reachable via TCP.

```ruby
redis['port'] = 6379
redis['bind'] = '127.0.0.1'
```

## Setting up a Redis-only server

If you'd like to setup a seperate Redis server (e.g. in the case of scaling
issues) for use with GitLab you can do so using GitLab Omnibus.

> **Note:** Redis does not require authentication by default. See
  [Redis Security](http://redis.io/topics/security) documentation for more
  information. We recommend using a combination of a Redis password and tight
  firewall rules to secure your Redis service.

1. Download/install GitLab Omnibus using **steps 1 and 2** from
   [GitLab downloads](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads). Do not complete other
   steps on the download page.
1. Create/edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and use the following configuration.
   Be sure to change the `external_url` to match your eventual GitLab front-end
   URL:

    ```ruby
    external_url 'https://gitlab.example.com'

    # Disable all services except Redis
    redis_master_role['enable'] = true

    # Redis configuration
    redis['port'] = 6379
    redis['bind'] = '0.0.0.0'

    # If you wish to use Redis authentication (recommended)
    redis['password'] = 'Redis Password'
    gitlab_rails['redis_password'] = 'Redis Password'

    # Disable automatic database migrations
    #   Only the primary GitLab application server should handle migrations
    gitlab_rails['auto_migrate'] = false
    ```

    > **Note:** The `redis_master_role['enable']` option is only available as of
    GitLab 8.14, see [`gitlab_rails.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/files/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab/libraries/gitlab_rails.rb)
    to understand which services are automatically disabled via that option.

1. Run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` to install and configure Redis.

## Increasing the number of Redis connections beyond the default

By default Redis will only accept 10,000 client connections. If you need
more that 10,000 connections set the 'maxclients' attribute to suite your needs.
Be advised that adjusting the maxclients attribute means that you will also need
to take into account your systems settings for fs.file-max (i.e. "sysctl -w fs.file-max=20000")

```ruby
redis['maxclients'] = 20000
```

## Tuning the TCP stack for Redis

The following settings are to enable a more performant Redis server instance. 'tcp_timeout' is
a value set in seconds that the Redis server waits before terminating an IDLE TCP connection.
The 'tcp_keepalive' is a tunable setting in seconds to TCP ACKs to clients in absence of
communication.

```ruby
redis['tcp_timeout'] = "60"
redis['tcp_keepalive'] = "300"
```

## Running with multiple Redis instances

GitLab includes support for running with separate redis instances for different persistence classes, currently: cache, queues, and shared_state.

1. Create a dedicated instance for each persistence class as per the instructions in [Setting up a Redis-only server][]
1. Set the appropriate variable in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` for each instance you are using:

    ```
    gitlab_rails['redis_cache_instance'] = REDIS_CACHE_URL
    gitlab_rails['redis_queues_instance'] = REDIS_QUEUES_URL
    gitlab_rails['redis_shared_state_instance'] = REDIS_SHARED_STATE_URL
    ```

    **Note**: Redis URLs should be in the format: "redis://:PASSWORD@REDIS_HOST:PORT/2"
    Where
    * PASSWORD is the plaintext password for the Redis instance
    * REDIS_HOST is the hostname or IP address of the host
    * REDIS_PORT is the port Redis is listening on, the default is 6379

1. Run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`
