# Redis settings

## Using a non-packaged Redis instance

If you want to use your own Redis instance instead of the bundled Redis, you
can use the `gitlab.rb` settings below. Run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` for the
settings to take effect.

```ruby
redis['enable'] = false

# Redis via TCP
gitlab_rails['redis_host'] = 'redis.example.com'
gitlab_rails['redis_port'] = 6380

# OR Redis via Unix domain sockets
gitlab_rails['redis_socket'] = '/tmp/redis.sock' # defaults to /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.socket
```

## Making a bundled Redis instance reachable via TCP

Use the following settings if you want to make one of the Redis instances
managed by omnibus-gitlab reachable via TCP.

```ruby
redis['port'] = 6379
redis['bind'] = '127.0.0.1'
```

## Increasing the number of Redis connections beyond the default

By default Redis will only accept 10,000 client connections. If you need
more that 10,000 connections set the 'maxclients' attribute to suite your needs.
Be advised that adjusting the maxclients attribute means that you will also need
to take into account your systems settings for fs.file-max (i.e. "sysctl -w fs.file-max=20000")

```ruby
redis['maxclients'] = 20000

## Tuning the TCP stack for Redis

The following settings are to enable a more performant Redis server instance. 'tcp_timeout' is
a value set in seconds that the Redis server waits before terminating an IDLE TCP connection.
The 'tcp_keepalive' is a tunable setting in seconds to TCP ACKs to clients in absence of 
communication.

```ruby
redis['tcp_timeout'] = "60"
redis['tcp_keepalive'] = "0"
```
