# Database settings

_**Note:**
Omnibus GitLab has a bundled PostgreSQL server and PostgreSQL is the preferred
database for GitLab._

---

GitLab supports the following database management systems:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL

Thus you have three options for database servers to use with Omnibus GitLab:

- Use the packaged PostgreSQL server included with GitLab Omnibus (no configuration required)
- Use an [external PostgreSQL server](#using-a-non-packaged-postgresql-database-management-server)
- Use an [external MySQL server](#using-a-mysql-database-management-server-enterprise-edition-only)

If you are planning to use MySQL/MariaDB, make sure to read the [MySQL special notes]
(#omnibus-mysql-special-notes) before proceeding.

## Using a non-packaged PostgreSQL database management server

By default, GitLab is configured to use the PostgreSQL server that is included
in Omnibus GitLab. You can also reconfigure it to use an external instance of
PostgreSQL.

**WARNING** If you are using non-packaged PostgreSQL server, you need to make
sure that PostgreSQL is set up according to the [database requirements document].

1.  Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

    ```ruby
    # Disable the built-in Postgres
    postgresql['enable'] = false

    # Fill in the connection details for database.yml
    gitlab_rails['db_adapter'] = 'postgresql'
    gitlab_rails['db_encoding'] = 'utf8'
    gitlab_rails['db_host'] = '127.0.0.1'
    gitlab_rails['db_port'] = '5432'
    gitlab_rails['db_username'] = 'USERNAME'
    gitlab_rails['db_password'] = 'PASSWORD'
    ```

    Don't forget to remove the `#` comment characters at the beginning of these
    lines.
    
    **Note:**
    `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` should have file permissions `0600` because it contains
    plain-text passwords.
    
1.  [Reconfigure GitLab][] for the changes to take effect.

1.  [Seed the database](#seed-the-database-fresh-installs-only).

### Backup and restore a non-packaged PostgreSQL database

When using the [rake backup create and restore task][rake-backup], GitLab will
attempt to use the packaged `pg_dump` command to create a database backup file
and the packaged `psql` command to restore a backup. This will only work if
they are the correct versions. Check the versions of the packaged `pg_dump` and
`psql`:

```bash
/opt/gitlab/bin/pg_dump --version
/opt/gitlab/bin/psql -- version
```

If these versions are different from your non-packaged external PostgreSQL
(most likely they are different), move them aside and replace them with
symbolic links to your non-packaged PostgreSQL:

1. Check the location of the non-packaged executables:

    ```bash
    which pg_dump psql
    ```
    
    This will output something like:

    ```
    /usr/bin/pg_dump
    /usr/bin/psql
    ```

1.  Move aside the existing executables and replace them with symbolic links to
    the non-packaged versions:

    ```bash
    cd /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin
    mv psql psql_moved
    mv pg_dump pg_dump_moved
    ln -s /usr/bin/pg_dump /usr/bin/psql /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/
    ```

1.  Re-check the versions:

    ```
    /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/pg_dump --version
    /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/psql --version
    ```

    They should now be the same as your non-packaged external PostgreSQL.
        
After this is done, ensure that the backup and restore tasks are using the
correct executables by running both the [backup][rake-backup] and
[restore][rake-restore] tasks.

## Omnibus MySQL special notes

MySQL in Omnibus is only supported in GitLab Enterprise Edition.
The MySQL server itself is _not_ shipped with Omnibus, you will have to install
it on your own or use an existing one. Omnibus ships only the MySQL client.

Make sure that GitLab's MySQL database collation is UTF-8, otherwise you could
hit [collation issues][ee-245]. See ['Set MySQL collation to UTF-8']
(#set-mysql-collation-to-utf-8) to fix any relevant errors.

## Using a MySQL database management server (Enterprise Edition only)

_**Important note:**
If you are connecting Omnibus GitLab to an existing GitLab database you should
[create a backup][rake-backup] before attempting this procedure._

---

The following guide assumes that you want to use MySQL or MariaDB and are using
the **GitLab Enterprise Edition packages**.

1.  First, set up your database server according to the [upstream GitLab
    instructions][mysql-install].

    If you want to keep using an existing GitLab database you can skip this step.

1.  Next, add the following settings to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

    ```ruby
    # Disable the built-in Postgres
    postgresql['enable'] = false

    # Fill in the values for database.yml
    gitlab_rails['db_adapter'] = 'mysql2'
    gitlab_rails['db_encoding'] = 'utf8'
    gitlab_rails['db_host'] = '127.0.0.1'
    gitlab_rails['db_port'] = '3306'
    gitlab_rails['db_username'] = 'USERNAME'
    gitlab_rails['db_password'] = 'PASSWORD'
    ```

    `db_adapter` and `db_encoding` should be like the example above. Change
    all other settings according to your MySQL setup.


1.  [Reconfigure GitLab][] for the changes to take effect.

1.  [Seed the database](#seed-the-database-fresh-installs-only).

**Note:**
`/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` should have file permissions `0600` because it contains
plain-text passwords.

## Seed the database (fresh installs only)

**This is a destructive command; do not run it on an existing database!**

---

Omnibus GitLab will not automatically seed your external database. Run the
following command to import the schema and create the first admin user:

```shell
# Remove 'sudo' if you are the 'git' user
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:setup
```

If you want to specify a password for the default `root` user, specify the
`initial_root_password` setting in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` before running the
`gitlab:setup` command above:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['initial_root_password'] = 'nonstandardpassword'
```

## Disabling automatic database migration

If you have multiple GitLab servers sharing a database, you will want limit the
number of nodes that are performing the migration steps during reconfiguration.

Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

```ruby
# Enable or disable automatic database migrations
gitlab_rails['auto_migrate'] = false
```

Don't forget to remove the `#` comment characters at the beginning of this
line.

**Note:**
`/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` should have file permissions `0600` because it contains
plain-text passwords.

The next time a reconfigure is triggered, the migration steps will not be performed.

## Troubleshooting

### Set MySQL collation to UTF-8

If you are hit by an error similar as described in [this issue][ee-245]
(_Mysql2::Error: Incorrect string value (\`st_diffs\` field)_), you
can change the collation of the faulty table with:

```bash
ALTER TABLE merge_request_diffs default character set = utf8 collate = utf8_unicode_ci;
ALTER TABLE merge_request_diffs convert to character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci;
```

In the above example the affected table is called `merge_request_diffs`.

### Connecting to the bundled PostgreSQL database

If you need to connect to the bundled PostgreSQL database and are
using the default Omnibus GitLab database configuration, you can
connect as the application user:

```bash
sudo gitlab-rails dbconsole
```

or as a Postgres superuser:

```bash
sudo gitlab-psql -d gitlabhq_production
```
