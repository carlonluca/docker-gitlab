# Configure SSL for the GitLab Linux package **(FREE SELF)**

The GitLab Linux package (Omnibus GitLab) supports several common use cases for
SSL configuration.

By default, HTTPS is not enabled. To enable HTTPS, you can:

- Use Let's Encrypt for free, automated HTTPS.
- Manually configure HTTPS with your own certificates.

NOTE:
If you use a proxy, load balancer or some other external device to terminate SSL for the GitLab host name,
see [External, proxy, and load balancer SSL termination](#configure-a-reverse-proxy-or-load-balancer-ssl-termination).

The following table shows which method each GitLab service supports.

| Service | Manual SSL | Let's Encrypt integration |
|-|-|-|
| GitLab instance domain | [Yes](#configure-https-manually) | [Yes](#enable-the-lets-encrypt-integration) |
| Container Registry | [Yes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/container_registry.html#configure-container-registry-under-its-own-domain) | [Yes](#enable-the-lets-encrypt-integration) |
| Mattermost | [Yes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/mattermost/index.html#running-gitlab-mattermost-with-https) | [Yes](#enable-the-lets-encrypt-integration) |
| GitLab Pages | [Yes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/pages/#wildcard-domains-with-tls-support) | No |

## Enable the Let's Encrypt integration

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) is enabled by default if `external_url`
is set with the HTTPS protocol and no other certificates are configured.

Prerequisites:

- Ports `80` and `443` must be accessible to the public Let's Encrypt servers
  that run the validation checks. The validation
  [does not work with non-standard ports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/3580).
  If the environment is private or air-gapped, certbot (the tool used by Let's Encrypt) provides a
  [manual method](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#manual)
  to install a Let's Encrypt certificate.

To enable Let's Encrypt:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and add or change the following entries:

   ```ruby
   ## GitLab instance
   external_url "https://gitlab.example.com"         # Must use https protocol
   letsencrypt['contact_emails'] = ['foo@email.com'] # Optional

   ## Container Registry (optional), must use https protocol
   registry_external_url "https://registry.example.com"
   #registry_nginx['ssl_certificate'] = "path/to/cert"      # Must be absent or commented out

   ## Mattermost (optional), must use https protocol
   mattermost_external_url "https://mattermost.example.com"
   ```

   - Certificates expire every 90 days. Email addresses you specify for `contact_emails` receive an
     alert when the expiration date approaches.
   - The GitLab instance is the
     primary domain name on the certificate. Additional services
     such as the Container Registry are added as alternate domain names to the same
     certificate. In the example above, the primary domain is `gitlab.example.com` and
     the Container Registry domain is `registry.example.com`. You don't need
     to set up wildcard certificates.

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

### Renew the certificates automatically

Default installations schedule renewals after midnight on every 4th day of the month.
The minute is determined by the value in `external_url` to help distribute the load
on the upstream Let's Encrypt servers.

To explicitly set the renewal times:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   # Renew every 7th day of the month at 12:30
   letsencrypt['auto_renew_hour'] = "12"
   letsencrypt['auto_renew_minute'] = "30"
   letsencrypt['auto_renew_day_of_month'] = "*/7"
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

NOTE:
The certificate is renewed only if it expires in 30 days.
For example, if you set it to renew on the 1st of every month at 00:00 and the
certificate expires on the 31st, then the certificate will expire before it's renewed.

To disable the automatic renewal:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   letsencrypt['auto_renew'] = false
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

### Renew the certificates manually

Renew the Let's Encrypt certificates manually using either one of the following commands:

```shell
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
```

```shell
sudo gitlab-ctl renew-le-certs
```

The previous commands only generate a renewal if the certificate is close to expiration.
If encountering an error during renewal, [consider the upstream rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/).

### Use an ACME server other than Let's Encrypt

You can use an ACME server other than Let's Encrypt, and configure GitLab to
use that to fetch a certificate. Some services that provide their own ACME
server are:

- [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/documentation/acme/)
- [Buypass](https://www.buypass.com/products/tls-ssl-certificates/go-ssl)
- [SSL.com](https://www.ssl.com/guide/ssl-tls-certificate-issuance-and-revocation-with-acme/)
- [`step-ca`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca)

To configure GitLab to use a custom ACME server:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and set the ACME endpoints:

   ```ruby
   external_url 'https://example.com'
   letsencrypt['acme_staging_endpoint'] = 'https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory'
   letsencrypt['acme_production_endpoint'] = 'https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory'
   ```

   If the custom ACME server provides it, use a staging endpoint as well.
   Checking the staging endpoint first ensures that the ACME configuration is correct
   before submitting the request to ACME production. Do this to avoid ACME
   rate-limits while working on your configuration.

   The default values are:

   ```plaintext
   https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
   https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

## Configure HTTPS manually

WARNING:
The NGINX configuration tells browsers and clients to only communicate with your
GitLab instance over a secure connection for the next 365 days using
[HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security).
See [Configure the HTTP Strict Transport Security](#configure-the-http-strict-transport-security-hsts)
for more configuration options. If enabling HTTPS, you must provide a
secure connection to your instance for at least the next 24 months.

To enable HTTPS:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:
   1. Set the `external_url` to your domain. Note the `https` in the URL:

      ```ruby
      external_url "https://gitlab.example.com"
      ```

   1. Disable the Let's Encrypt integration:

      ```ruby
      letsencrypt['enable'] = false
      ```

      GitLab attempts to renew any Let's Encrypt certificate with every reconfigure.
      If you plan to use your own manually created certificate you must disable
      the Let's Encrypt integration, otherwise the certificate could be overwritten
      due to the automatic renewal.

1. Create the `/etc/gitlab/ssl` directory and copy your key and certificate there:

   ```shell
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/gitlab/ssl
   sudo chmod 755 /etc/gitlab/ssl
   sudo cp gitlab.example.com.key gitlab.example.com.crt /etc/gitlab/ssl/
   ```

   In the example, the hostname is `gitlab.example.com`, so Omnibus GitLab
   looks for private key and public certificate files called
   `/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.example.com.key` and `/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.example.com.crt`,
   respectively. If you want, you can
   [use a differente location and certificates names](#change-the-default-ssl-certificate-location).

   You must use the full certificate chain, in the correct order, to prevent
   SSL errors when clients connect: first the server certificate,
   then all intermediate certificates, and finally the root CA.

1. Optional. If the `certificate.key` file is password protected, NGINX doesn't ask for
   the password when you reconfigure GitLab. In that case, Omnibus GitLab
   fails silently with no error messages.

   To remove the password from the key:

   ```shell
   openssl rsa -in certificate_before.key -out certificate_after.key
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

1. Optional. If you are using a firewall, you may have to open port 443 to allow inbound
   HTTPS traffic:

   ```shell
   # UFW example (Debian, Ubuntu)
   sudo ufw allow https

   # lokkit example (RedHat, CentOS 6)
   sudo lokkit -s https

   # firewall-cmd (RedHat, Centos 7)
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
   sudo systemctl reload firewalld
   ```

If you are updating existing certificates, follow a
[different process](#update-the-ssl-certificates).

### Redirect `HTTP` requests to `HTTPS`

By default, when you specify an `external_url` starting with `https`, NGINX
no longer listens for unencrypted HTTP traffic on port 80. To redirect all HTTP
traffic to HTTPS:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   nginx['redirect_http_to_https'] = true
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

NOTE:
This behavior is enabled by default when using the [Let's Encrypt integration](#enable-the-lets-encrypt-integration).

### Change the default HTTPS port

If you need to use an HTTPS port other than the default (443), specify it
as part of the `external_url`:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   external_url "https://gitlab.example.com:2443"
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

### Change the default SSL certificate location

If your hostname is `gitlab.example.com`, Omnibus GitLab
looks for a private key called `/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.example.com.key`
and a public certificate called `/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.example.com.crt`
by default.

To set a different location of the SSL certificates:

1. Create a directory, give it the appropriate permissions, and place the
   `.crt` and `.key` files in the directory:

   ```shell
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/gitlab/ssl
   sudo chmod 755 /mnt/gitlab/ssl
   sudo cp gitlab.key gitlab.crt /mnt/gitlab/ssl/
   ```

   You must use the full certificate chain, in the correct order, to prevent
   SSL errors when clients connect: first the server certificate,
   then all intermediate certificates, and finally the root CA.

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   nginx['ssl_certificate'] = "/mnt/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.crt"
   nginx['ssl_certificate_key'] = "/mnt/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.key"
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

### Update the SSL certificates

If the content of your SSL certificates has been updated, but no configuration
changes have been made to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`, then reconfiguring GitLab
doesn't affect NGINX. Instead, you must cause NGINX to
[reload the existing configuration and new certificates](http://nginx.org/en/docs/control.html)
gracefully:

```shell
sudo gitlab-ctl hup nginx registry
```

## Configure a reverse proxy or load balancer SSL termination

By default, Omnibus GitLab auto-detects whether to use SSL if `external_url`
contains `https://` and configures NGINX for SSL termination.
However, if you configure GitLab to run behind a reverse proxy or an external load balancer,
some environments may want to terminate SSL outside the GitLab application.

To prevent the bundled NGINX from handling SSL termination:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   nginx['listen_port'] = 80
   nginx['listen_https'] = false
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

The external load balancer may need access to a GitLab endpoint
that returns a `200` status code (for installations requiring login, the root
page returns a `302` redirect to the login page). In that case, it's
recommended to leverage a
[health check endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/monitoring/health_check.html).

Other bundled components, like the Container Registry, GitLab Pages, or Mattermost,
use a similar strategy for proxied SSL. Set the particular component's `*_external_url` with `https://` and
prefix the `nginx[...]` configuration with the component name. For example, the
GitLab Container Registry configuration is prefixed with `registry_`:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

  ```ruby
  registry_external_url 'https://registry.example.com'

  registry_nginx['listen_port'] = 80
  registry_nginx['listen_https'] = false
  ```

  The same format can be used for Pages (`pages_` prefix) and Mattermost (`mattermost_` prefix).

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

1. Optional. You may need to configure your reverse proxy or load balancer to
   forward certain headers (for example `Host`, `X-Forwarded-Ssl`, `X-Forwarded-For`,
   `X-Forwarded-Port`) to GitLab (and Mattermost if you use one). If you forget
   this step, you may see improper redirections or errors, like
   "422 Unprocessable Entity" or "Can't verify CSRF token authenticity".

Some cloud provider services, such as AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), do not all
w the download of certificates. This prevents them from being used to terminate
on the GitLab instance. If SSL is desired between such a cloud service and
GitLab, another certificate must be used on the GitLab instance.

## Use custom SSL ciphers

By default, GitLab is using SSL ciphers that are a combination of testing on
<https://gitlab.com> and various best practices contributed by the GitLab community.

To change the SSL ciphers:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   nginx['ssl_ciphers'] = "CIPHER:CIPHER1"
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

To enable the `ssl_dhparam` directive:

1. Generate `dhparams.pem`:

   ```shell
   openssl dhparam -out /etc/gitlab/ssl/dhparams.pem 2048
   ```

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   nginx['ssl_dhparam'] = "/etc/gitlab/ssl/dhparams.pem"
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

## Configure the HTTP/2 protocol

By default, when you specify that your GitLab instance is reachable
through HTTPS, the [HTTP/2 protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) is
also enabled.

The Omnibus GitLab package sets the required SSL ciphers that are compatible with
the HTTP/2 protocol.

If you specify your own [custom SSL ciphers](#use-custom-ssl-ciphers) and a cipher is
in the [HTTP/2 cipher blacklist](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#appendix-A),
when you try to reach your GitLab instance you are presented with the
`INADEQUATE_SECURITY` error in your browser. In that case, consider removing the
offending ciphers from the cipher list. Changing ciphers is only necessary if
you have a very specific custom setup.

For more information on why you would want to have the HTTP/2 protocol enabled,
check out the
[NGINX HTTP/2 whitepaper](https://assets.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NGINX_HTTP2_White_Paper_v4.pdf?_ga=1.127086286.212780517.1454411744).

If changing the ciphers is not an option, you can disable the HTTP/2 support:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   nginx['http2_enabled'] = false
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

NOTE:
The HTTP/2 setting only works for the main GitLab application and not for the other services,
like GitLab Pages, Container Registry, and Mattermost.

## Enable 2-way SSL client authentication

To require web clients to authenticate with a trusted certificate, you can
enable 2-way SSL:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   nginx['ssl_verify_client'] = "on"
   nginx['ssl_client_certificate'] = "/etc/pki/tls/certs/root-certs.pem"
   ```

1. Optional. You can configure how deeply in the certificate chain NGINX should verify
   before deciding that the clients don't have a valid certificate (default is `1`).
   Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   nginx['ssl_verify_depth'] = "2"
   ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

## Configure the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

NOTE:
The HSTS settings only work for the main GitLab application and not for the other services,
like GitLab Pages, Container Registry, and Mattermost.

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled by default and it informs browsers that
they should only contact the website using HTTPS. When a browser visits a
GitLab instance even once, it remembers to no longer attempt insecure connections,
even when the user is explicitly entering a plain HTTP URL (`http://`). Plain
HTTP URLs are automatically redirected by the browser to the `https://` variant.

By default, `max_age` is set for two years, this is how long a browser will
remember to only connect through HTTPS.

To change the max age value:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   nginx['hsts_max_age'] = 63072000
   nginx['hsts_include_subdomains'] = false
   ```

   Setting `max_age` to `0` disables HSTS.

1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

For more information on HSTS and NGINX, see <https://www.nginx.com/blog/http-strict-transport-security-hsts-and-nginx/>.

## Install custom public certificates

Some environments connect to external resources for various tasks. Omnibus GitLab
allows these connections to use HTTPS, and supports connections with self-signed certificates.

Omnibus GitLab ships with the official [CAcert.org](http://www.cacert.org/)
collection of trusted root certification authorities which are used to verify
certificate authenticity.

NOTE:
For installations that use self-signed certificates, Omnibus GitLab
provides a way to manage these certificates. For more technical details how
this works, see the [details](#details-on-how-gitlab-and-ssl-work)
at the bottom of this page.

To install custom public certificates:

1. Generate the **PEM** or **DER** encoded public certificate from your private key certificate.
1. Copy only the public certificate file in the `/etc/gitlab/trusted-certs` directory.
   By default, GitLab expects to find a certificate titled after your GitLab domain name with a `.crt`
   extension. For instance, if your server address is `https://gitlab.example.com`, the
   certificate should be named `gitlab.example.com.crt`.

   To specify a different path and file name, you can
   [change the default SSL certificate location](#change-the-default-ssl-certificate-location).

1. [Enable and manually configure HTTPS on NGINX](#configure-https-manually) to set up GitLab to use your own certificates.
1. Reconfigure GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

WARNING:
If using a custom certificate chain, the root and intermediate certificates must
be put into separate files in `/etc/gitlab/trusted-certs`
[due to `c_rehash` creating a hash for the first certificate only](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/1425).

## Details on how GitLab and SSL work

GitLab-Omnibus includes its own library of OpenSSL and links all compiled
programs (e.g. Ruby, PostgreSQL, etc.) against this library. This library is
compiled to look for certificates in `/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs`.

GitLab-Omnibus manages custom certificates by symlinking any certificate that
gets added to `/etc/gitlab/trusted-certs/` to `/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs`
using the [c_rehash](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/c_rehash.html)
tool. For example, let's suppose we add `customcacert.pem` to
`/etc/gitlab/trusted-certs/`:

```shell
$ sudo ls -al /opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs

total 272
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jul 12 04:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jul  6 04:00 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     42 Jul 12 04:19 7f279c95.0 -> /etc/gitlab/trusted-certs/customcacert.pem
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 263781 Jul  5 17:52 cacert.pem
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    147 Feb  6 20:48 README
```

Here we see the fingerprint of the certificate is `7f279c95`, which links to
the custom certificate.

What happens when we make an HTTPS request? Let's take a simple Ruby program:

```ruby
#!/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/ruby
require 'openssl'
require 'net/http'

Net::HTTP.get(URI('https://www.google.com'))
```

This is what happens behind the scenes:

1. The "require `openssl`" line causes the interpreter to load `/opt/gitlab/embedded/lib/ruby/2.3.0/x86_64-linux/openssl.so`.
1. The `Net::HTTP` call then attempts to read the default certificate bundle in `/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/cacert.pem`.
1. SSL negotiation occurs.
1. The server sends its SSL certificates.
1. If the certificates that are sent are covered by the bundle, SSL finishes successfully.
1. Otherwise, OpenSSL may validate other certificates by searching for files
   that match their fingerprints inside the predefined certificate directory. For
   example, if a certificate has the fingerprint `7f279c95`, OpenSSL will attempt
   to read `/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/7f279c95.0`.

Note that the OpenSSL library supports the definition of `SSL_CERT_FILE` and
`SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variables. The former defines the default
certificate bundle to load, while the latter defines a directory in which to
search for more certificates. These variables should not be necessary if you
have added certificates to the `trusted-certs` directory. However, if for some
reason you need to set them, they can be [defined as environment variables](environment-variables.md). For example:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['env'] = {"SSL_CERT_FILE" => "/usr/lib/ssl/private/customcacert.pem"}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Useful OpenSSL Debugging Commands

Sometimes it's helpful to get a better picture of the SSL certificate chain by viewing it directly
at the source. These commands are part of the standard OpenSSL library of tools for diagnostics and
debugging.

NOTE:
GitLab includes its own [custom-compiled version of OpenSSL](#details-on-how-gitlab-and-ssl-work)
that all GitLab libraries are linked against. It's important to run the following commands using
this OpenSSL version.

- Perform a test connection to the host over HTTPS. Replace `HOSTNAME` with your GitLab URL
  (excluding HTTPS), and replace `port` with the port that serves HTTPS connections (usually 443):

  ```shell
  echo | /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/openssl s_client -connect HOSTNAME:port
  ```

  The `echo` command sends a null request to the server, causing it to close the connection rather
  than wait for additional input. You can use the same command to test remote hosts (for example, a
  server hosting an external repository), by replacing `HOSTNAME:port` with the remote host's domain
  and port number.

  This command's output shows you the certificate chain, any public certificates the server
  presents, along with validation or connection errors if they occur. This makes for a quick check
  for any immediate issues with your SSL settings.

- View a certificate's details in text form using `x509`. Be sure to replace
  `/path/to/certificate.crt` with the certificate's path:

  ```shell
  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/openssl x509 -in /path/to/certificate.crt -text -noout
  ```

  For example, GitLab automatically fetches and places certificates acquired from Let's Encrypt at
  `/etc/gitlab/ssl/hostname.crt`. You can use the `x509` command with that path to quickly display
  the certificate's information (for example, the hostname, issuer, validity period, and more).

  If there's a problem with the certificate, [an error occurs](#custom-certificates-missing-or-skipped).

- Fetch a certificate from a server and decode it. This combines both of the above commands to fetch
  the server's SSL certificate and decode it to text:

  ```shell
  echo | /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/openssl s_client -connect HOSTNAME:port | /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/openssl x509 -text -noout
  ```

See the [troubleshooting SSL documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/troubleshooting/ssl.html)
for more examples of troubleshooting SSL problems with OpenSSL.

### Common SSL errors

1. `SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate`

    This error indicates the client cannot get the root CA. To fix this, you can either [trust the root CA](#install-custom-public-certificates) of the server you are trying to connect to on the client or [modify the certificate](#configure-https-manually) to present the full chained certificate on the server you are trying to connect to.

    NOTE:
    It is recommended to use the full certificate chain in order to prevent SSL errors when clients connect. The full certificate chain order should consist of the server certificate first, followed by all intermediate certificates, with the root CA last.

1. `unable to verify the first certificate`

    This error indicates that an incomplete certificate chain is being presented by the server. To fix this error, you will need to [replace server's certificate with the full chained certificate](#configure-https-manually). The full certificate chain order should consist of the server certificate first, followed by all intermediate certificates, with the root CA last.

1. `certificate signed by unknown authority`

    This error indicates that the client does not trust the certificate or CA. To fix this error, the client connecting to server will need to [trust the certificate or CA](#install-custom-public-certificates).

1. `SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain`

    This error indicates that the client does not trust the certificate or CA. To fix this error, the client connecting to server will need to [trust the certificate or CA](#install-custom-public-certificates).

1. `x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead`

    This error indicates that [SANs](http://wiki.cacert.org/FAQ/subjectAltName) (subjectAltName) must be configured in the certificate. For more information, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/28841).
      
### Git-LFS and other embedded services written in ***golang*** report custom certificate signed by unknown authority

NOTE:
In GitLab 11.5, the following workaround is no longer necessary, embedded golang apps now [use the standard GitLab certificate directory automatically](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/3701).

The `gitlab-workhorse` and other services written in ***golang*** use the **crypto/tls** library from ***golang***
instead of **OpenSSL**.

Add the following entry in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` to work around the
[issue as reported](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/-/issues/177#note_90203818):

```ruby
gitlab_workhorse['env'] = {
  'SSL_CERT_DIR' => '/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/'
}
```

NOTE:
If you have installed GitLab to a path other than `/opt/gitlab/` then modify the entry above
with the correct path in your operating environment.

### Reconfigure Fails Due to Certificates

```shell
ERROR: Not a certificate: /opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/FILE. Move it from /opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs to a different location and reconfigure again.
```

Check `/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs` and remove any files other than `README.md` that aren't valid X.509 certificates.

NOTE:
Running `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` constructs symlinks named from the subject hashes
of your custom public certificates and places them in `/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/`.
Broken symlinks in `/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/` will be automatically removed.
Files other than `cacert.pem` and `README.md` stored in
`/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/` will be moved into the `/etc/gitlab/trusted-certs/`.

### Custom Certificates Missing or Skipped

GitLab versions ***8.9.0***, ***8.9.1***, and ***8.9.2*** all mistakenly used the
`/etc/gitlab/ssl/trusted-certs/` directory. This directory is safe to remove if it
is empty. If it still contains custom certificates then move them to `/etc/gitlab/trusted-certs/`
and run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.

If no symlinks are created in `/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/` and you see
the message "Skipping `cert.pem`" after running `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`, that
means there may be one of four issues:

1. The file in `/etc/gitlab/trusted-certs/` is a symlink
1. The file is not a valid PEM or DER-encoded certificate
1. Perl is not installed on the operating system which is needed for c_rehash to properly symlink certificates
1. The certificate contains the string `TRUSTED`

Test the certificate's validity using the commands below:

```shell
/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/openssl x509 -in /etc/gitlab/trusted-certs/example.pem -text -noout
/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/openssl x509 -inform DER -in /etc/gitlab/trusted-certs/example.der -text -noout
```

Invalid certificate files produce the following output:

```shell
unable to load certificate
140663131141784:error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line:pem_lib.c:701:Expecting: TRUSTED CERTIFICATE
```

To test if `c_rehash` is not symlinking the certificate due to a missing perl interpreter:

```shell
$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/c_rehash /etc/gitlab/trusted-certs

bash: /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/c_rehash: /usr/bin/perl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
```

If you see this message, you will need to install perl with your distribution's package manager.

If you inspect the certificate itself, then look for the string `TRUSTED`:

```plaintext
-----BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END TRUSTED CERTIFICATE-----
```

If it does, like the example above, then try removing the string `TRUSTED` and running `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` again.

### Custom certificates not detected

If after running `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`:

1. no symlinks are created in `/opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/`;
1. you have placed custom certificates in `/etc/gitlab/trusted-certs/`; and
1. you do not see any skipped or symlinked custom certificate messages

You may be encountering an issue where Omnibus GitLab thinks that the custom
certificates have already been added.

To resolve, delete the trusted certificates directory hash:

```shell
rm /var/opt/gitlab/trusted-certs-directory-hash
```

Then run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` again. The reconfigure should now detect and symlink
your custom certificates.

### Let's Encrypt Certificate signed by unknown authority

The initial implementation of Let's Encrypt integration only used the certificate, not the full certificate chain.

Starting in 10.5.4, the full certificate chain will be used. For installs which are already using a certificate, the switchover will not happen until the renewal logic indicates the certificate is near expiration. To force it sooner, run the following

```shell
rm /etc/gitlab/ssl/HOSTNAME*
gitlab-ctl reconfigure
```

Where HOSTNAME is the hostname of the certificate.

### Let's Encrypt fails on reconfigure

When you reconfigure, there are common scenarios under which Let's Encrypt may fail:

1. Let's Encrypt may fail if your server isn't able to reach the Let's Encrypt verification servers or vice versa:

   ```shell
   letsencrypt_certificate[gitlab.domain.com] (letsencrypt::http_authorization line 3) had an error: RuntimeError: acme_certificate[staging]  (/opt/gitlab/embedded/cookbooks/cache/cookbooks/letsencrypt/resources/certificate.rb line 20) had an error: RuntimeError: [gitlab.domain.com] Validation failed for domain gitlab.domain.com
   ```

    If you run into issues reconfiguring GitLab due to Let's Encrypt [make sure you have ports 80 and 443 open and accessible](#enable-the-lets-encrypt-integration).

1. Your domain's Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) record does not allow Let's Encrypt to issue a certificate for your domain. Look for the following error in the reconfigure output:

   ```shell
   letsencrypt_certificate[gitlab.domain.net] (letsencrypt::http_authorization line 5) had an error: RuntimeError: acme_certificate[staging]   (/opt/gitlab/embedded/cookbooks/cache/cookbooks/letsencrypt/resources/certificate.rb line 25) had an error: RuntimeError: ruby_block[create certificate for gitlab.domain.net] (/opt/gitlab/embedded/cookbooks/cache/cookbooks/acme/resources/certificate.rb line 108) had an error: RuntimeError: [gitlab.domain.com] Validation failed, unable to request certificate
   ```

1. If you're using a test domain such as `gitlab.example.com`, without a certificate, you'll see the `unable to request certificate` error shown above. In that case, disable Let's Encrypt by setting `letsencrypt['enable'] = false` in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`.

You can test your domain using the [Let's Debug](https://letsdebug.net/) diagnostic tool. It can help you figure out why you can't issue a Let's Encrypt certificate.
