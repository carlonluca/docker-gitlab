# Error: gitlab.VersionText

# Checks that multi-line version text is formatted correctly.

# Specifically, looks for multi-line version text that doesn't use `-` to make it a list.
# For example:
#
# - `> Introduced in GitLab 14.0.
# - `> Removed in GitLab 15.0.
#
# For a list of all options, see https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/getting-started/styles
