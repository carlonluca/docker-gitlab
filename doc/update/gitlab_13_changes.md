# GitLab 13 specific changes

NOTE: **Note:**
When upgrading to a new major version, remember to first [check for background migrations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/README.html#checking-for-background-migrations-before-upgrading).

## 13.0

### Puma becoming default web server instead of Unicorn

Starting with GitLab 13.0, Puma will be the default web server used in
`omnibus-gitlab` based installations. This will be the case for both fresh
installations as well as upgrades, unless [users have explicitly disabled Puma
and enabled Unicorn](../settings/unicorn.md#enabling-unicorn). Users who have
Unicorn configuration are recommended to refer to [the docs on how to convert them to Puma ones](../settings/puma.md#converting-unicorn-settings-to-puma).

### PostgreSQL 11 becoming minimum required version

To upgrade to GitLab 13.0 or later, users must be already running PostgreSQL 11.
PostgreSQL 9.6 and 10 [have been removed from](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/4186)
the package. Follow [the documentation](../settings/database.md#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server)
on how to upgrade the packaged PostgreSQL server to required version.

## 13.3

### PostgreSQL 12.3 support

PostgreSQL 12.3 is being shipped with the package in addition to 11.7 which is still the default version.
Both fresh installs and upgrades will still continue to use 11.7, but users can manually upgrade to 12.3 following the
[upgrade docs](../settings/database.md#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server). Note that PostgreSQL 12 is not supported
for Geo deployments in GitLab 13.3 and is planned for the 13.4 release.

## 13.5

### Default workhorse listen socket moved

In 13.5, the default location for the workhorse socket was moved from `/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/socket`
to `/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/sockets/socket`. If you are using your own NGINX rather than the bundled version,
and are proxying to the workhorse socket, you will need to update your NGINX config.
