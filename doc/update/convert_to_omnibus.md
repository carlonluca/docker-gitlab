# Upgrading from a non-Omnibus installation to an Omnibus installation **(FREE SELF)**

Upgrading from non-Omnibus installations has not been tested by GitLab.com.

Please be advised that you lose your settings in files such as `gitlab.yml`,
`puma.rb` and `smtp_settings.rb`. You must
[configure those settings in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`](../index.md#configuring).

Before starting the migration, ensure that you are moving to **exactly the same version** of GitLab.
To convert your installation to Omnibus:

1. If your current GitLab installation uses MySQL, you first need to migrate
   your data to PostgreSQL, because starting with GitLab 12.1, PostgreSQL is the
   only supported database management system. If you already use PostgreSQL, skip this step.
   1. Verify the [PostgreSQL requirements and supported versions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html#postgresql-requirements),
   then [install PostgreSQL and create a database](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/installation.html#6-database).
   1. After the database is created, [migrate the MySQL data to PostgreSQL](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/mysql_to_postgresql.html#source-installation).

1. Create a backup from your current installation:

   ```shell
   cd /home/git/gitlab
   sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production
   ```

1. [Install GitLab using a Linux package](https://about.gitlab.com/install/).
1. Copy the backup file to the directory `/var/opt/gitlab/backups/` of the new server.
1. Restore the backup in the new installation ([detailed instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html#restore-for-omnibus-gitlab-installations)):

   ```shell
   # This command will overwrite the contents of your GitLab database!
   sudo gitlab-backup restore BACKUP=<FILE_NAME>
   ```

   The restore takes a few minutes depending on the size of you database and Git data.

1. Configure the new installation as in Omnibus GitLab all settings are stored in
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`. Individual settings need to be manually moved from
   files such as `gitlab.yml`, `puma.rb` and `smtp_settings.rb`. See the
   [`gitlab.rb` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/files/gitlab-config-template/gitlab.rb.template)
   for all available options.
1. To finalize the configuration process, copy the secrets from the old installation
   to the new one. GitLab uses secrets to multiple purposes, like database encryption,
   session encryption, and so on. In Omnibus GitLab all secrets are placed in a single
   file `/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json`, whereas in source installations, the
   secrets are placed in multiple files:
   1. First, you need to restore secrets related to Rails. Copy the values of
      `db_key_base`, `secret_key_base` and `otp_key_base` from
      `/home/git/gitlab/config/secrets.yml` (GitLab source) to the equivalent
      ones in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json` (Omnibus GitLab).
   1. Then, copy the contents of `/home/git/gitlab-shell/.gitlab_shell_secret`
      (GitLab source) to GitLab Shell's `secret_token` in
      `/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json` (Omnibus GitLab). It will look something like:

       ```json
       {
         "gitlab_workhorse": {
           "secret_token": "..."
         },
         "gitlab_shell": {
           "secret_token": "..."
         },
         "gitlab_rails": {
           "secret_key_base": "...",
           "db_key_base": "...",
           "otp_key_base": "...",
         }
         ...
       }
       ```

1. Reconfigure Omnibus GitLab to apply the changes:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

1. If you migrated `/home/git/gitlab-shell/.gitlab_shell_secret`, you also [need to restart Gitaly](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/3837):

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart gitaly
   ```

## Upgrading from non-Omnibus PostgreSQL to an Omnibus installation using a backup

Upgrade by [creating a backup from the non-Omnibus install](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html#creating-a-backup-of-the-gitlab-system)
and [restoring this in the Omnibus installation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html#restore-for-omnibus-installations).
Ensure you are using **exactly equal versions** of GitLab (for example 6.7.3)
when you do this. You might have to upgrade your non-Omnibus installation before
creating the backup to achieve this.

After upgrading make sure that you run the check task:

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check
```

If you receive an error similar to `No such file or directory @ realpath_rec - /home/git`,
run this one liner to fix the Git hooks path:

```shell
find . -lname /home/git/gitlab-shell/hooks -exec sh -c 'ln -snf /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell/hooks $0' {} \;
```

This assumes that `gitlab-shell` is located in `/home/git`.

## Upgrading from non-Omnibus PostgreSQL to an Omnibus installation in-place

It is also possible to upgrade a source GitLab installation to Omnibus GitLab
in-place. Below we assume you are using PostgreSQL on Ubuntu, and that you
have an Omnibus GitLab package matching your current GitLab version. We also
assume that your source installation of GitLab uses all the default paths and
users.

First, stop and disable GitLab, Redis and NGINX.

```shell
# Ubuntu
sudo service gitlab stop
sudo update-rc.d gitlab disable

sudo service nginx stop
sudo update-rc.d nginx disable

sudo service redis-server stop
sudo update-rc.d redis-server disable
```

If you are using a configuration management system to manage GitLab on your
server, remember to also disable GitLab and its related services there. Also
note that in the following steps, the existing home directory of the Git user
(`/home/git`) will be changed to `/var/opt/gitlab`.

Next, create a `gitlab.rb` file for your new setup:

```shell
sudo mkdir /etc/gitlab
sudo tee -a /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb <<'EOF'
# Use your own GitLab URL here
external_url 'http://gitlab.example.com'

# We assume your repositories are in /home/git/repositories (default for source installs)
git_data_dirs({ 'default' => { 'path' => '/home/git' } })

# Re-use the PostgreSQL that is already running on your system
postgresql['enable'] = false
# This db_host setting is for Debian PostgreSQL packages
gitlab_rails['db_host'] = '/var/run/postgresql/'
gitlab_rails['db_port'] = 5432
# We assume you called the GitLab DB user 'git'
gitlab_rails['db_username'] = 'git'
EOF
```

Now install the Omnibus GitLab package and reconfigure it:

```shell
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
```

You are not done yet! The `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` run has changed the home
directory of the Git user, so OpenSSH can no longer find its authorized_keys
file. Rebuild the keys file with the following command:

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:shell:setup
```

You should now have HTTP and SSH access to your GitLab server with the
repositories and users that were there before.

If you can log into the GitLab web interface, the next step is to reboot your
server to make sure none of the old services interferes with Omnibus GitLab.

If you are using special features such as LDAP you will have to put your
settings in `gitlab.rb`, see the [settings docs](../settings/index.md).

## Upgrading from non-Omnibus MySQL to an Omnibus installation (version 6.8+)

Starting with GitLab 12.1, PostgreSQL is the only support database management
system. So, if your non-Omnibus installation is running a GitLab version before
12.1 and is using MySQL, you will have to migrate to PostgreSQL before upgrading
to 12.1.

To convert to PostgreSQL and use the built-in server, follow the steps:

- [Create a backup of the non-Omnibus MySQL installation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html#creating-a-backup-of-the-gitlab-system)
- [Export and convert the existing MySQL database in the GitLab backup file](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/mysql_to_postgresql.html)
- [Restore this in the Omnibus installation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html#restore-for-omnibus-installations)
