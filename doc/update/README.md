## Documentation version

Please make sure you are viewing this file on the master branch.

## Updating using the official repositories

If you have installed Omnibus GitLab [Community Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads)
or [Enterprise Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads-ee/), then the
official GitLab repository should have already been set up for you.

To update to a newer GitLab version, all you have to do is:

```
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gitlab-ce

# Centos/RHEL
sudo yum install gitlab-ce
```

If you are an Enterprise Edition user, replace `gitlab-ce` with `gitlab-ee` in
the above commands.

## Updating by manually downloading the official packages

If for some reason you don't use the official repositories, it is possible to
download the package and install it manually.

1. Visit the [Community Edition repository](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce)
   or the [Enterprise Edition repository](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ee)
   depending on the edition you already have installed.
1. Find the package version you wish to install and click on it.
1. Click the 'Download' button in the upper right corner to download the package.
1. Once the GitLab package is downloaded, install it using the following
   commands, replacing `XXX` with the Omnibus GitLab version you downloaded:

    ```
    # Debian/Ubuntu
    dpkg -i gitlab-ce-XXX.deb

    # CentOS/RHEL
    rpm -Uvh gitlab-ce-XXX.rpm
    ```

    If you are an Enterprise Edition user, replace `gitlab-ce` with `gitlab-ee`
    in the above commands.

## From Community Edition to Enterprise Edition

>**Note:**
Make sure you have retrieved your license file before installing
GitLab Enterprise Edition, otherwise you will not be able to use certain
features.

To upgrade an existing GitLab Community Edition (CE) server, installed using the
Omnibus packages, to GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE), all you have to do is
install the EE package on top of CE. While upgrading from the same version of
CE to EE is not explicitly necessary, and any standard upgrade jump (i.e. 8.0
to 8.7) should work, in the following steps we assume that you are upgrading the
same versions.

The steps can be summed up to:

1. Find the currently installed GitLab version:

    **For Debian/Ubuntu**

    ```
    sudo apt-cache policy gitlab-ce | grep Installed
    ```

    The output should be similar to: `Installed: 8.6.7-ce.0`. In that case,
    the equivalent Enterprise Edition version will be: `8.6.7-ee.0`. Write this
    value down.

    ---

    **For CentOS/RHEL**

    ```
    sudo rpm -q gitlab-ce
    ```

    The output should be similar to: `gitlab-ce-8.6.7-ce.0.el7.x86_64`. In that
    case, the equivalent Enterprise Edition version will be:
    `gitlab-ee-8.6.7-ee.0.el7.x86_64`. Write this value down.

1. Add the `gitlab-ee` [Apt or Yum repository](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ee/install):

    **For Debian/Ubuntu**

    ```
    curl -s https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
    ```

    **For CentOS/RHEL**

    ```
    curl -s https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
    ```

    ---

    The above command will find your OS version and automatically set up the
    repository. If you are not comfortable installing the repository through a
    piped script, you can first
    [check its contents](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ee/install).

1. Next, install the `gitlab-ee` package. Note that this will automatically
   uninstall the `gitlab-ce` package on your GitLab server. Reconfigure
   Omnibus right after the `gitlab-ee` package is installed. Make sure that you
   install the exact same GitLab version:

    **For Debian/Ubuntu**

    ```
    ## Make sure the repositories are up-to-date
    sudo apt-get update

    ## Install the package using the version you wrote down from step 1
    sudo apt-get install gitlab-ee=8.6.7-ee.0

    ## Reconfigure GitLab
    sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
    ```

    **For CentOS/RHEL**

    ```
    ## Install the package using the version you wrote down from step 1
    sudo yum install gitlab-ee-8.6.7-ee.0.el7.x86_64

    ## Reconfigure GitLab
    sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
    ```

    > **Note:**
    If you want to upgrade to EE and at the same time also update GitLab to the
    latest version, you can omit the version check in the above commands. For
    Debian/Ubuntu that would be `sudo apt-get install gitlab-ee` and for
    CentOS/RHEL `sudo yum install gitlab-ee`.

1. Now go to the GitLab admin panel of your server (`/admin/license/new`) and
   upload your license file.

1. After you confirm that GitLab is working as expected, you may remove the old
   Community Edition repository:

    **For Debian/Ubuntu**

    ```
    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gitlab_gitlab-ce.list
    ```

    ---

    **For CentOS/RHEL**

    ```
    sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/gitlab_gitlab-ce.repo
    ```

That's it! You can now use GitLab Enterprise Edition! To update to a newer
version follow the section on
[Updating using the official repositories](#updating-using-the-official-repositories).

>**Note:**
If you want to use `dpkg`/`rpm` instead of `apt-get`/`yum`, go through the first
step to find the current GitLab version and then follow the steps in
[Updating by manually downloading the official packages](#updating-by-manually-downloading-the-official-packages).

## Updating from GitLab 8.10 and lower to 8.11 or newer

GitLab 8.11 introduces new key names for several secrets, to match the GitLab
Rails app and clarify the use of the secrets. For most installations, this
process should be transparent as the 8.11 and higher packages will try to
migrate the existing secrets to the new key names.

### Migrating legacy secrets

These keys have been migrated from old names:

- `gitlab_rails['otp_key_base']` is used for encrypting the OTP secrets in the
  database. Changing this secret will stop two-factor auth from working for all
  users. Previously called `gitlab_rails['secret_token']`
- `gitlab_rails['db_key_base']` is used for encrypting import credentials and CI
  secret variables. Previously called `gitlab_ci['db_key_base']`; **note** that
  `gitlab_rails['db_key_base']` was not previously used for this - setting it
  would have no effect
- `gitlab_rails['secret_key_base']` is used for password reset links, and other
  'standard' auth features. Previously called `gitlab_ci['db_key_base']`;
  **note** that `gitlab_rails['secret_token']` was not previously used for this,
  despite the name

These keys were not used any more, and have simply been removed:

- `gitlab_ci['secret_token']`
- `gitlab_ci['secret_key_base']`

## Updating from GitLab 6.6 and higher to 7.10 or newer

In the 7.10 package we have added the `gitlab-ctl upgrade` command, and we
configured the packages to run this command automatically after the new package
is installed. If you are installing GitLab 7.9 or earlier, please see the
[procedure below](#updating-from-gitlab-66-and-higher-to-the-latest-version).

If you installed using the package server all you need to do is run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gitlab-ce` (for Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo yum install gitlab-ce` (for CentOS/Enterprise Linux).

If you are not using the package server, consider [upgrading to the package repository](https://about.gitlab.com/upgrade-to-package-repository). Otherwise, download the latest [CE](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce) or
[EE (subscribers only)](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ee)
package to your GitLab server then all you have to do is `dpkg -i gitlab-ce-XXX.deb` (for Debian/Ubuntu) or `rpm
-Uvh gitlab-ce-XXX.rpm` (for CentOS/Enterprise Linux). After the package has
been unpacked, GitLab will automatically:

- Stop all GitLab services;
- Create a backup using your current, old GitLab version. This is a 'light'
  backup that **only backs up the SQL database**;
- Run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`, which will perform any necessary database
  migrations (using the new GitLab version);
- Restart the services that were running when the upgrade script was invoked.

If you do not want the DB-only backup, automatic start/stop and DB migrations
to be performed automatically please run the following command before upgrading
your GitLab instance:

```
sudo touch /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations
```

## Updating from GitLab 6.6 and higher to the latest version

The procedure can also be used to upgrade from a CE omnibus package to an EE omnibus package.

First, download the latest [CE](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce) or
[EE (license key required)](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads-ee/)
package to your GitLab server.

#### Stop services but leave postgresql running for the database migrations and create a backup

```shell
sudo gitlab-ctl stop unicorn
sudo gitlab-ctl stop sidekiq
sudo gitlab-ctl stop nginx
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:create
```

#### Install the latest package

```
# Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo dpkg -i gitlab_x.x.x-omnibus.xxx.deb

# CentOS:
sudo rpm -Uvh gitlab-x.x.x_xxx.rpm
```

#### Reconfigure GitLab (includes running database migrations) and restart all services

```
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
sudo gitlab-ctl restart
```

Done!

## Updating from GitLab 6.6.0.pre1 to 6.6.4

First, download the latest package from https://www.gitlab.com/downloads/ to your GitLab server.


#### Stop unicorn and sidekiq so we can do database migrations

```shell
sudo gitlab-ctl stop unicorn
sudo gitlab-ctl stop sidekiq
```

#### One-time migration because we changed some directories since 6.6.0.pre1

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/gitlab/git-data
sudo mv /var/opt/gitlab/{repositories,gitlab-satellites} /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/
sudo mv /var/opt/gitlab/uploads /var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/
```

#### Install the latest package

```
# Ubuntu:
sudo dpkg -i gitlab_6.6.4-omnibus.xxx.deb

# CentOS:
sudo rpm -Uvh gitlab-6.6.4_xxx.rpm
```

#### Reconfigure GitLab (includes database migrations)

```
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
```

#### Start unicorn and sidekiq

```
sudo gitlab-ctl start
```

Done!

## Reverting to GitLab 6.6.x or later

This section contains general information on how to revert to an earlier version of a package.

*NOTE* This guide assumes that you have a backup archive created under the version you are reverting to.

These steps consist of:

* Download the package of a target version.(example below uses GitLab 6.x.x)
* Stop GitLab
* Install the old package
* Reconfigure GitLab
* Restoring the backup
* Starting GitLab

See example below:

First download a GitLab 6.x.x [CE](https://www.gitlab.com/downloads/archives/) or
[EE (subscribers only)](https://gitlab.com/subscribers/gitlab-ee/blob/master/doc/install/packages.md)
package.


#### Stop GitLab

```
sudo gitlab-ctl stop unicorn
sudo gitlab-ctl stop sidekiq
```

#### Downgrade GitLab to 6.x

```
# Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -r gitlab
sudo dpkg -i gitlab-6.x.x-yyy.deb

# CentOS:
sudo rpm -e gitlab
sudo rpm -ivh gitlab-6.x.x-yyy.rpm
```

#### Prepare GitLab for receiving the backup restore

Due to a backup restore bug in versions earlier than GitLab 6.8.0, it is needed to drop the database
_before_ running `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`, only if you are downgrading to 6.7.x or less.

```
sudo -u gitlab-psql /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/dropdb gitlabhq_production
```

#### Reconfigure GitLab (includes database migrations)

```
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
```

#### Restore your backup

```
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:restore BACKUP=12345 # where 12345 is your backup timestamp
```

#### Start GitLab

```
sudo gitlab-ctl start
```

## Upgrading from a non-Omnibus installation to an Omnibus installation
Upgrading from non-Omnibus installations has not been tested by GitLab.com.

Please be advised that you lose your settings in files such as gitlab.yml, unicorn.rb and smtp_settings.rb.
You will have to [configure those settings in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb](/README.md#configuration).

### Upgrading from non-Omnibus PostgreSQL to an Omnibus installation using a backup
Upgrade by [creating a backup from the non-Omnibus install](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/raketasks/backup_restore.md#create-a-backup-of-the-gitlab-system) and [restoring this in the Omnibus installation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/raketasks/backup_restore.md#omnibus-installations).
Please ensure you are using exactly equal versions of GitLab (for example 6.7.3) when you do this.
You might have to upgrade your non-Omnibus installation before creating the backup to achieve this.

After upgrading make sure that you run the check task: `sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check`.

If you receive an error similar to `No such file or directory @ realpath_rec - /home/git` run this one liner to fix the git hooks path:

```bash
find . -lname /home/git/gitlab-shell/hooks -exec sh -c 'ln -snf /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell/hooks $0' {} \;
```

This assumes that `gitlab-shell` is located in `/home/git`

### Upgrading from non-Omnibus PostgreSQL to an Omnibus installation in-place
It is also possible to upgrade a source GitLab installation to omnibus-gitlab
in-place.  Below we assume you are using PostgreSQL on Ubuntu, and that you
have an omnibus-gitlab package matching your current GitLab version.  We also
assume that your source installation of GitLab uses all the default paths and
users.

First, stop and disable GitLab, Redis and Nginx.

```
# Ubuntu
sudo service gitlab stop
sudo update-rc.d gitlab disable

sudo service nginx stop
sudo update-rc.d nginx disable

sudo service redis-server stop
sudo update-rc.d redis-server disable
```

If you are using a configuration management system to manage GitLab on your
server, remember to also disable GitLab and its related services there. Also
note that in the following steps, the existing home directory of the git user
(`/home/git`) will be changed to `/var/opt/gitlab`.


Next, create a `gitlab.rb` file for your new setup.

```
sudo mkdir /etc/gitlab
sudo tee -a /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb <<'EOF'
# Use your own GitLab URL here
external_url 'http://gitlab.example.com'

# We assume your repositories are in /home/git/repositories (default for source installs)
git_data_dirs({ 'default' => '/home/git' })

# Re-use the Postgres that is already running on your system
postgresql['enable'] = false
# This db_host setting is for Debian Postgres packages
gitlab_rails['db_host'] = '/var/run/postgresql/'
gitlab_rails['db_port'] = 5432
# We assume you called the GitLab DB user 'git'
gitlab_rails['db_username'] = 'git'
EOF
```

Now install the omnibus-gitlab package and run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.

You are not done yet! The `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` run has changed the home
directory of the git user, so OpenSSH can no longer find its authorized_keys
file. Rebuild the keys file with the following command:

```
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:shell:setup
```

You should now have HTTP and SSH access to your GitLab server with the
repositories and users that were there before.

If you can log into the GitLab web interface, the next step is to reboot your
server to make sure none of the old services interferes with omnibus-gitlab.

If you are using special features such as LDAP you will have to put your
settings in gitlab.rb; see the [omnibus-gitlab
README](/README.md#configuration).


### Upgrading from non-Omnibus MySQL to an Omnibus installation (version 6.8+)
Unlike the previous chapter, the non-Omnibus installation is using MySQL while the Omnibus installation is using PostgreSQL.

Option #1: Omnibus packages for EE can be configured to use an external [non-packaged MySQL database](/README.md#using-a-mysql-database-management-server-enterprise-edition-only).

Option #2: Convert to PostgreSQL and use the built-in server as the instructions below.

* [Create a backup of the non-Omnibus MySQL installation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/raketasks/backup_restore.md#create-a-backup-of-the-gitlab-system)
* [Export and convert the existing MySQL database in the GitLab backup file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/update/mysql_to_postgresql.md#converting-a-gitlab-backup-file-from-mysql-to-postgres)
* [Restore this in the Omnibus installation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/98b1bfb0d70082953d63abbc329cd6f2c628d3bc/README.md#restoring-an-application-backup)
* [Rebuild database indexes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/update/mysql_to_postgresql.md#for-omnibus-gitlab-installations)
* Enjoy!

## RPM 'package is already installed' error

If you are using RPM and you are upgrading from GitLab Community Edition to GitLab Enterprise Edition you may get an error like this:

```
package gitlab-7.5.2_omnibus.5.2.1.ci-1.el7.x86_64 (which is newer than gitlab-7.5.2_ee.omnibus.5.2.1.ci-1.el7.x86_64) is already installed
```

You can override this version check with the `--oldpackage` option:

```
rpm -Uvh --oldpackage gitlab-7.5.2_ee.omnibus.5.2.1.ci-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

## Updating GitLab CI via omnibus-gitlab

### Updating from GitLab CI version prior to 5.4.0 to version 7.14

>**Warning:**
Omnibus GitLab 7.14 was the last version where CI was bundled in the package.
Starting from GitLab 8.0, CI was merged into GitLab, thus it's no longer a
separate application included in the Omnibus package.

In GitLab CI 5.4.0 we changed the way GitLab CI authorizes with GitLab.

In order to use GitLab CI 5.4.x, GitLab 7.7.x is required.

Make sure that GitLab 7.7.x is installed and running and then go to Admin section of GitLab.
Under Applications create a new a application which will generate the `app_id` and `app_secret`.

In `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

```
gitlab_ci['gitlab_server'] = { "url" => 'http://gitlab.example.com', "app_id" => '12345678', "app_secret" => 'QWERTY12345' }

```

where `url` is the url to the GitLab instance.

Make sure to run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` after saving the configuration.

## Troubleshooting

Use the following commands to check the status of GitLab services and configuration files.

```
sudo gitlab-ctl status
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true
```
