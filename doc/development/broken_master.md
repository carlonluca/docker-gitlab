# Handling broken master pipelines

We currently run [nightly pipelines](pipelines.md#scheduled-pipelines) for
building both CE and EE package in [our Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab).
This mirror is configured to send pipeline failure notifications to
`#g_distribution` channel on Slack. A broken master pipeline gets priority over
other scheduled work as per our [development guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#resolution-of-broken-master).

## `dependency_scanning` job failed due to one of the dependencies being reported as vulnerable

1. Check the job log and find out which component is marked `Vulnerable`

1. Open a confidential issue in [`omnibus-gitlab` issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/)
   giving details about the vulnerability and a link to the failed job.

1. Label the issue with the `security` and `For Scheduling` labels. GitLab's
   Security team will be made aware of this issue, thanks to the automation in
   place by [escalator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/automation/escalator).

1. Once an issue has been filed, ask a
   [Maintainer of the project](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/#omnibus-gitlab)
   to add the CVE to the `CVEIGNORE` environment variable defined in the project
   settings, in [Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab).
   This will ensure the master pipeline won't keep failing and flood the Slack
   channel with notifications while we triage the issue based on severity, and
   priority.

1. Security team, with the help of Distribution, triages the issue and schedules
   it accordingly.

1. If the issue is found out to be a no-op for our usecase, open
   an MR adding the variable to the [`.cveignore`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/blob/master/.cveignore)
   file.

1. If the issue is found out to be actionable for us, it goes through the
   regular scheduling process based on its severity and priority and gets
   necessary MRs (targeting master and relevant backport stable branches).

1. Ensure the entry is removed from the `CVEIGNORE` variable once the MRs have
   been merged. This handles the edge false-negative case where a vulnerability
   might affect multiple components and only one of them was fixed by an MR. Removing
   an item from the `.cveignore` file can be done through a public MR to the Omnibus
   repository.

## Raspberry Pi jobs timed out in pending state waiting to be scheduled

From time to time, we see Scaleway driver for `docker-machine` failing in properly
provisioning and de-provisioning machines. THis will result in new machines not
being spun up for builds, and the jobs end up timing out waiting for a machine.

1. Follow [maintenance documentation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/distribution/maintenance/build-machines.html#when-builds-are-pending-on-devgitlaborg)
   and delete all the machines that are not running.

1. If machines are present in `Off` state (gray icon), you can manually batch
   delete them.

1. Ensure new machines are being started up.

1. Retry the failed jobs (only Maintainers can do this) and ensure it gets
   picked up by a machine.

## Jobs are stuck due to no runners being active

This is a transient error due to connection issues between runner manager
machine and `dev.gitlab.org`.

1. Sign in to [runner manager machine](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/distribution/maintenance/build-machines.html#build-runnersgitlaborg).

1. Run the following command to force a connection between runner and GitLab

    ```shell
    sudo gitlab-runner verify
    ```
