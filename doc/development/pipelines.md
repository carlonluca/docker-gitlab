# CI Pipelines

`omnibus-gitlab` CI pipeline is a moderately complex one with pipelines split
between all the mirrors of the project:

1. [Development repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab) for normal feature development.
1. [Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab) for building release artifacts.
1. [Security mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/omnibus-gitlab) for security development.
1. [QA mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/omnibus-gitlab-mirror) for developers to run a package build and QA for development
   purposes.

## Types of pipelines

### Branch pipelines

`omnibus-gitlab` doesn't make use of detached merge request pipelines yet. So,
pipelines caused by branch pushes are the common pipelines encountered in this
project. These pipelines are used in [Development repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab), [Security mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/omnibus-gitlab),
and [Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab).

### Tag pipelines

Tag pushes to [Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab) starts a pipeline with the
[release jobs](#release-jobs). Tag pushes to [Development repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab) and [Security
mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/omnibus-gitlab) behaves as regular branch pushes (except that they don't have an option
to start a package-and-qa pipeline) and run basic stylistic checks and unit
tests.

### Scheduled pipelines

In [Development repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab), there are two scheduled pipelines.

1. `Dependencies Update` - Pipeline to check for outdated dependencies using the
   [`dependency_update`](#dependency_update) job.
1. `Generate license pages` - Pipeline to populate [License collection webpage](http://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/omnibus-gitlab/licenses.html)
   with license information from the S3 bucket.

In [Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab), there are two scheduled pipelines

1. `CE nightly` - Pipeline to build nightly packages and docker images for
   GitLab CE
1. `EE nightly` - Pipeline to build nightly packages and docker images for
   GitLab EE

Other mirrors doesn't have any scheduled pipelines

### Auto-deploy pipelines

GitLab uses [Auto deploy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/deploy/auto-deploy.md) branches and tags for its release process. These
branches are named `<MAJOR>-<MINOR>-auto-deploy-<TIMESTAMP>` and tags have the
format `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<TIMESTAMP>+<gitlab sha>.<omnibus-gitlab sha>`.

Only certain jobs - that are needed to deploy the changes to GitLab
environments - will be part of this pipeline.

### Triggered pipelines

We use triggered pipelines to run a "package-and-qa" pipeline in the [QA
mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/omnibus-gitlab-mirror). These can be triggered either from a pipeline in the [Development
mirror] or [GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab).

This pipeline is intended to give the developers a package and an image to test
their changes in addition to automatically doing a QA run against these
artifacts. It also provides an option to do a QA run against an HA instance spun
up using these artifacts, and to run a memory measurement job to measure the
resource usage by GitLab using the docker image.

## CI Jobs

### Development Jobs

We have tests covering our Chef recipes and libraries using `RSpec` and
`Chefspec`. They are parallelized with the help of
[knapsack](https://github.com/ArturT/knapsack).

This job pulls in the knapsack reports of previous pipeline runs from the cache
and gets them in place for the current spec runs.

and tag pipelines.

and prepares a final JSON report. This report is used by the MR widget to
display spec status, and is also uploaded to the cache for the next pipeline run
to use.

developers to get a package or docker image for testing, or to run a full QA
suite against their MR's changes.

pipelines push it as a docker image, which we pull in here and copy the assets
themselves to a predefined location.
