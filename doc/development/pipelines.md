# Repositories, branches, and CI pipelines

`omnibus-gitlab` CI pipeline is a moderately complex one with pipelines split
between all the mirrors of the project:

1. [Development repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab) for normal feature development.
1. [Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab) for building release artifacts.
1. [Security mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/omnibus-gitlab) for security development.
1. [QA mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/omnibus-gitlab-mirror) for developers to run a package build and QA for development
   purposes.

## Branch and tag protection

### Protected branches

NOTE:
Unless specified otherwise, the listed users/groups have permission to both merge, and push to
protected branches.

1. Development repository
    1. `master`: Maintainers, [Delivery team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/delivery)
    1. `*-stable` : [Delivery team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/delivery), [Release Managers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/managers)
    1. `*-stable-ee` : [Delivery team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/delivery), [Release Managers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/managers)
    1. `*-auto-deploy-*` : Maintainers, [`delivery` group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/delivery), [`managers` group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/managers)

1. Release mirror:
    1. `master`: Maintainers
    1. `*-stable` : Maintainers
    1. `*-stable-ee` : Maintainers
    1. `*-auto-deploy-*` : Maintainers

1. Security mirror:
    1. `master`: [GitLab Release Tools Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-release-tools-bot), [GitLab Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot), [Delivery team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/delivery), [Release Managers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/managers)
    1. `*-stable`: [GitLab Release Tools Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-release-tools-bot), [GitLab Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot), [Delivery team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/delivery), [Release Managers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/managers)
    1. `*-stable-ee`: [GitLab Release Tools Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-release-tools-bot), [GitLab Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot), [Delivery team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/delivery), [Release Managers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/managers)
    1. `*-auto-deploy-*`: [GitLab Release Tools Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-release-tools-bot), [GitLab Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot), [Delivery team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/delivery), [Release Managers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/managers)

1. QA mirror:
    1. `master`: Developers (Merge only), Maintainers

NOTE:
Developers get access to `master` branch in QA mirror because
that's required to run a triggered pipeline against the branch. There is an
[open issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24585) to change this
situation.

### Protected Tags

NOTE:
Unless specified otherwise, the listed users/groups have permission to both merge, and push to
protected tags.

1. Development repository:
    1. `*` : Maintainers, [Delivery team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/delivery), [Release Managers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/managers)

1. Release mirror:
    1. `*`: Maintainers

1. Security mirror: Nil

1. QA mirror: Nil

## Mirroring between repositories

Most of the development happens in the [Development repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab)
and security related changes go to [Security mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/omnibus-gitlab).
These changes then gets mirrored to [Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab)
and [QA mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/omnibus-gitlab-mirror). The
following diagram describes what all gets mirrored between each of these
repositories.

## Types of pipelines

### Branch pipelines

`omnibus-gitlab` doesn't make use of detached merge request pipelines yet. So,
pipelines caused by branch pushes are the common pipelines encountered in this
project. These pipelines are used in [Development repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab), [Security mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/omnibus-gitlab),
and [Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab).

### Tag pipelines

Tag pushes to [Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab) starts a pipeline with the
[release jobs](#release-jobs). Tag pushes to [Development repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab) and [Security
mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/omnibus-gitlab) behaves as regular branch pushes (except that they don't have an option
to start a package-and-qa pipeline) and run basic stylistic checks and unit
tests.

### Scheduled pipelines

In [Development repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab), there are two scheduled pipelines.

1. `Dependencies Update` - Pipeline to check for outdated dependencies using the
   [`dependency_update`](#dependency_update) job.
1. `Generate license pages` - Pipeline to populate [License collection webpage](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/omnibus-gitlab/licenses.html)
   with license information from the S3 bucket.

In [Release mirror](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab), there are two scheduled pipelines

1. `CE nightly` - Pipeline to build nightly packages and Docker images for
   GitLab CE
1. `EE nightly` - Pipeline to build nightly packages and Docker images for
   GitLab EE

Other mirrors doesn't have any scheduled pipelines

### Auto-deploy pipelines

GitLab uses [Auto deploy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/deploy/auto-deploy.md) branches and tags for its release process. These
branches are named `<MAJOR>-<MINOR>-auto-deploy-<TIMESTAMP>` and tags have the
format `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<TIMESTAMP>+<gitlab sha>.<omnibus-gitlab sha>`.

Only certain jobs - that are needed to deploy the changes to GitLab
environments - will be part of this pipeline.

### Triggered pipelines

We use triggered pipelines to run a "package-and-qa" pipeline in the [QA
mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/omnibus-gitlab-mirror). These can be triggered either from a pipeline in the
[Development repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab) or [GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab).

This pipeline is intended to give the developers a package and an image to test
their changes in addition to automatically doing a QA run against these
artifacts. It also provides an option to do a QA run against an HA instance spun
up using these artifacts.

## CI Jobs

[knapsack](https://github.com/ArturT/knapsack).

This job pulls in the knapsack reports of previous pipeline runs from the cache
and gets them in place for the current spec runs.
