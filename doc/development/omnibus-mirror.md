# omnibus-mirror

In order to minimize the dependency on external resources during our build and release process, we maintain a mirror of various software dependencies within GitLab resources.

The system consists of two groups, one on GitLab.com, and the other on `dev.gitlab.org`

1. [GitLab.com projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/omnibus-mirror)

   1. Pull mirrors of the upstream source, and push mirrors to the corresponding `dev.gitlab.org` project.
   1. Publically available. Should be available to the `trigger-package` pipeline, as well as community developers for building custom `omnibus-gitlab` packages

1. [`dev.gitlab.org` projects](https://dev.gitlab.org/omnibus-mirror)

   1. Pipelines on `dev.gitlab.org` use these projects to build `omnibus-gitlab` projects. This includes the package releases, as well as builds used by GitLab Team members to build custom `omnibus-gitlab` packages for all supported platforms.

## Adding a project
