## What does this MR do?

(briefly describe what this MR is about)

## Changing the header title?

- [ ] Is it completely necessary to change the title? Changing titles breaks deep linking. If yes, proceed further.
- [ ] Move the old heading title to the bottom of the page.
- [ ] Change the header tag to h5, `#####`.

## Moving docs to a new location?

See the guidelines: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/#changing-document-location>.

- [ ] Make sure the old link is not removed and has its contents replaced with a link to the new location.
- [ ] Make sure internal links pointing to the document in question are not broken.
