# Omnibus-GitLab only needs to know very little about the system it is running
# on. We want to disable as many Ohai plugins as we can to avoid plugin bugs
# and speed up 'gitlab-ctl reconfigure'.
#
# The list below, based on Ohai 7.4.1, is a blacklist. UNcomment a plugin to
# disable it. For example, ':Groovy,' is uncommented because omnibus-gitlab
# does not care about Groovy.
